## Updated: "allvariables.xlsx". Setting the frame for the soil nitrogen submodel implementation
## All additions/changes are in red font (NOT red highlighting!)
## Additionnally, existing values that got modified are in bold italic

- Added / modified variables related to the upcoming addition of the Soil Nitrogen module
  Name for corresponding R module in the excel is "rSoilNitrogen"

- Changed some soil-specific variable types in allvariables.xslx for variables that are dependent on soil layer.
  A lot were single "numeric" data while we would actually need either a data.frame or 10 different variables, one
  for each possible soil layer (i.e pSoilOrganicN.1, pSoilOrganicN.2 ... pSoilOrganicN.10 )

- Presently, some layer-dependent variables are represented as 10 different ones, while some are composed of a single
  data.frame (supposedly 1-dimensional). What would the convention be if we were to decide what variable should
  be represented as a data.frame and which should be split into 10 numeric variables ?
  For now, I decided to implement state variables (subject to vary during the simulation) as different numeric variables and
  soil parameters (that will remain constant throughout) as data frames

- Specifically, pSoilCurveNumber, parameter allowing calculation of the drainage factor, would be considered layer-specific,
  changed its type from "numeric" to "data.frame"

- iniWL, U, and DRAINF new names were changed so they fit the naming convention (cf. "Translation of SSM into R.pdf")

- VPDF type is "SoilParameter"
  The excel model did not consider it a soil parameter but it was instead in the "Location" tab
  So it would seem it's rather a parameter of Latitude / Longitude
  Description explains it's a parameter depending on climate, that varies from 0.65 for humid/sub-humid climates to 0.75 for arid ones
  Thus, changed its type from "SoilParameter" to "LocationParameter" although none other variables are of this type
  Might fit into a better type.

- There is an ambiguity for certain variables that represent INITIAL values. Should they be considered as inputs or parameters ?
  For instance, initial amount of soluble N in L layer...
  There also is some ambiguity for variables that represent the sum of each layer's value
  For example total amount of soluble N in soil being the sum of each layer's amount
  Should the be considered as computed variables or state variables ?
  Probably needs to have it figured out for each single variable specifically.

- U, renamed to "pU", is a parameter for calculating evaporation, shouldn't it be specific to each layer ? Or are
  we assuming that evaporation only happens in the very top layer, no matter how thin it could be ?

- In the excel, organic N amount and organic N percentage were considered "parameters". Changed their types to state variables
  as we will be interested in tracking their values, and their changes, especially when implementing the break down of legume crops
  as a way to recycle their fixated N into organic N for the soil
